# Code-Refactor

## Description

In this project, we were tasked to refactor a static web page for Horiseon Solution Services. The goal was to ensure that we used semantic HTML elements that followed a logical structure as indicated by the format of the page. We also needed to make sure the site was accessible to a certain degree. Other little adjustments, such as adding a meaningful title and cleaning up CSS were also done to give the site's code a more professional feel.
